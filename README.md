# Like Grass
A free _Bungou Stray Dogs_ fan-game.

> You awaken in a bloodstained and empty ballroom. Somehow, you get the feeling that you weren't expecting to.
> 
> Unsure of exactly who you are and what you're doing in this world you must nevertheless venture bravely forth into Yokohama's dark streets, oddly so much more dilapidated than you ever imagined.
